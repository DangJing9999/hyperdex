  "What's the use case of HyperDex?": "",
  "HyperDex DeFi envisions the creation of the first decentralized finance investment platform for digital assets mirroring the standard financial products, but with a major difference that everything is decentralized and automated.": "",
  "Over the past few years, the digital assets industry has developed constantly to find bridge solutions from the current obsolete financial system into the current fast and relentless digital one. For the first time, HyperDex allows standard financial products to be available in a DeFi platform. In fact, HyperDex as a successful DeFi investment platform fulfills the crypto market need by routing the crypto assets of the users into different HyperDex products. It accomplishes this by using algorithms and staking with the ultimate aim of offering the best returns. With their funds put in HyperDex, asset holders are stress-free. HyperDex mitigates the risks inherent to DeFi that cannot be managed by a single passive investor especially when they begin their journey as an investor. HyperDex DeFi mainly focuses on investors who don’t have time and energy to make the most out of DeFi opportunities. Investors are lured by the potential of the DeFI industry but lost by the inherent challenges of accessing reliable products. Investment in DeFi has become an optimistic and genuine factor for financial independence but is unachievable without proper tools and strategies. This is where HyperDex comes into the picture, allowing anyone owning crypto assets to invest in its platforms through the integration of crypto wallets such as MetaMask and Exodus. Even without any prior DeFi knowledge, the users will be able to connect to HyperDex’s platform and invest in its products.": "",
  "What are the investment cubes?": "",
  "We created new containers with functions very similarly to the liquidity pools on decentralized exchanges. These containers are called “cubes.” The user can opt for a cube of their choice to select a particular investment strategy and generate the expected income which will always be known without any hidden fees or market mechanics.": "",
  "What are the main functions of HyperDex?": "",
  "HyperDex DeFi investment platform offers three different types of investment strategies each with varied returns and risks. The following is the list of investments:": "",
  "1. Fix Income</div><div>Fixed income cubes are investment strategies that offer a fixed income to the users on either stable coins or other crypto assets.": "",
  "2. Algorithm Trading": "",
  "Algo-trading cubes are automated trading protocols, based on a pure statistical arbitrage algorithm. Algo-trading cubes aim at bringing higher returns by identifying the market discrepancies among the leading crypto assets.": "",
  "3. Race Trading": "",
  "Race trading cubes are very similar to that of cryptocurrency prediction markets. HyperDex’s race-trading cube is based on a decentralized, trustless prediction-market platform, where the users can speculate the outcomes of future prices of the chosen crypto assets. In short, HyperDex will not make predictions, it just indicates what is being traded heavily at the moment in terms of shorts and longs. The user then makes a prediction on the future price, and then, the HyperDex Race cube automatically calculates the necessary information for the user. Stops, as well the position in the market (long or short), with the proper leverage (risk chosen by the user). Each of the above strategies is collectively put in containers to differentiate the strategy chosen and expiration time. These containers are called “cubes.” Cubes function very similarly to the liquidity pools on decentralized exchanges. The user can opt for a cube of their choice to select a particular investment strategy and generate the expected income which will always be known without any hidden fees or market mechanics.": "",
  "How to transform a cube into a HyperCube?": "",
  "The user will be able to select, from several cube choices, a fixed income investment offering returns on either stable coins or cryptocurrency. Every cube has its own expiration date and details about the final return on investment as well as its pay-back rules.": "",
  "An early redemption is possible with a flat 20% fee of the initial investment.": "",
  "The funds will be managed partly across fixed income generating staking programs, and partly traded with proprietary arbitrage algorithms.": "",
  "The user's investments will be initially collected into our smart contract, visible on the BSC blockchain for further distribution into our staking and trading accounts. At expiration, our smart contract will call back the funds necessary to fulfill the payment obligation.": "",
  "To transform a cube into a HyperCube, the following steps are necessary:": "",
  "1. The user must obtain Hyper Tokens from swaps, the pre-sale, or other HyperCubes profits.": "",
  "2. The user must invest into the cube an equivalent value of Hyper Tokens in a range that varies from 10 to 100% of the main stable coin or crypto cube’s investment.": "",
  "3. Once obtained, the HyperCube status of the fixed income return of the previous basic cube will increase. The HyperCube fixed income return also adds a bonus percentage onto the main investment and gives a Hyper Tokens return on the secondary investment. See examples below. 4. A Hyper Token cube with a 20% per annum fixed income return will be created as well. The users can simply deposit in the cube any Hyper Token purchased through swaps in our liquidity pool or through the platform’s rewards.": "",
  "Commission Plan": "",
  "Each cube will have its own commission parameters as listed below.": "",
  "Fix income cube: deposit fee 0.3% (deducted immediately from the deposited coin).": "",
  "Algo Trading: deposit/management fee 2% (deducted immediately from the deposited coin) & net profit performance fee of 20% (deducted at cube’s expiration).": "",
  "Race cube: deposit fee 0.5% (deducted immediately from the deposited coin).": "",
  "Farms": "",
  "Once a liquidity pool investment has been made, the peer receives an LP-Token. Our system has planned to create yielding farms to take advantage of the LP-Tokens. However our farms are based on a fix income return in order to maintain under control even with this feature the minting production. The planned annualized return of our farming is set at 20%.": "",
  "What are HyperDex fourth dimensional returns?": "",
  "The user, by investing in any of the cubes, has the choice to simultaneously earn “parallel” profits by transforming the cube into HyperCube. In fact, on the expiration date the cube will only be paying a basic percentage reward on the underlying asset; however, the HyperCube will be paying a double reward and increasing the basic percentage reward. Therefore, the HyperCube profits will be generating a reward in the invested currencies (for ex. USDT or BNB) and in Hyper Token with its own percentage value indicated at the time of investment. As such, if the cube’s reward was 100 USDT, the HyperCube will add an additional profit in Hyper Token.": "",
  "What is Hyper Token?": "",
  "HYP (Hyper Token) is the platform native token, and can only be obtained through swapping or minting. After the pre-sale phase, the token’s minting will occur every time a user’s profit is due (see CUBE section). In order to mint tokens and prevent inflation or deflation issues, any of HyperCube’s profits will be minting only the Hyper Tokens expected from the percentage reward. For example, at expiration the fixed-income basic cube generates a profit of 100 USDT for the user. The HyperCube generates a higher return on the 100 USDT plus 100 USDT in Hyper Tokens. If the Hyper Token at that moment is worth 1 USDT, an additional profit of 100 Hyper Tokens will be minted for the user. In the example above, if at expiration the Hyper Token was worth 2 USDT, the total minting amount would have been 50 tokens, and so on.": "",
  "Tokens minted = profit in USDT / Hyper Token USDT value.": "",
  "The HyperDex platform’s commissions for any new USDT or other coin investments will not mint new tokens, but will deduct tokens directly from the investment.": "",
  "What’s Hyper Token advantage?": "",
  "Our system is based on the Binance Smart Chain, similar to a standard DeFi project with profound added layers; we are calculating with vast simulations, based on the price formula variation, the optimal minting and liquidity supply correlation. In order to obtain predictable control over the circulating supply, we have developed a system that mints tokens on demand when someone generates profit using one of our platform’s features. Only during the pre-sale phase we are minting a determined amount of tokens, capped to a maximum of 200% of the total initial liquidity invested by the users. Therefore, even in the long term, the ratio between circulating supply and liquidity pools will always be under control and never exceed the extreme numbers. In fact, with our on-demand minting system, we always mint new tokens as a reward for a previous user’s injection of liquidity into the pools. The main advantage of HyperDex is that we don’t need an exponential production of tokens to obtain the user’s interest, usually based on high-yielding returns. However, we are attracting them by creating a stable ecosystem where the price value rises as more liquidity flows into the system with a controlled minting structure. The goal is to obtain a token-scarcity production, as the more the price increases, the less the system mints new tokens.This is because minting occurs with a formula directly proportional to the platform’s stable coin or main crypto rewards.": "",
  "What are your incentives?": "",
  "The following steps are used to incentivize the user’s investments, with extra bonuses on the profit given in form of tokens:": "",
  "0 – 100 (USDT value) no additional Hyper Token": "",
  "101 – 500 (USDT value) 2.5 % extra Hyper Token on top of the profit": "",
  "500 – 1000 (USDT value) 5 % extra Hyper Token on top of the profit 1001 – 10000 (USDT value) 7.5 % extra Hyper Token on top of the profit & > 10001 (USDT value) 10 % extra Hyper Token on top of the profit": "",
  "Can I trust HyperDex?": "",
  "YES, the HyperDex Team has gained great knowledge in the Decentralized Finance sector: you can take advantage of our experience to receive maximum profit. HyperDex's smart contract has been tested countless times to offer investors the best investment experience.": "",
